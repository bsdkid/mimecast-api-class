# Mimecast API

Provides a simple, basic class to the Mimecast API.  Currently supports only a few methods which were immediately required to do what I needed but will be extended over time.

### Mimecast.py
Class file with a few simple methods.

### get-TTP.py
A simple example showing use of the Class which downloads files from TTP automatically.

### TODO
Yes I know it's ugly and needs additional work to be more useful... please feel free to contribute and grow.
