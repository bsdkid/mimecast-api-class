# Mimecast API

Provides a simple, basic class to the Mimecast API. Currently supports only a few methods which were immediately required to do what I needed but will be extended over time.

I wrote this because the only example I could find was a single monolithic script which used httplib and I wanted something a little cleaner and more extensible.

### Requirements
* Python 3
* Install requirements listed in requirements.txt via pip

### Mimecast.py
Class file with a few simple methods.

### get-TTP.py
A simple example showing use of the Class which downloads files from TTP automatically.

### TODO
Yes I know it's ugly and needs additional work to be more useful... please feel free to contribute and grow.

### Contributors
Thanks to James Stephenson for helping to grow and improve the code base
